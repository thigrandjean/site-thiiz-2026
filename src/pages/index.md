Hi, my name is **Thiago Grandjean**, I'm a graphic designer based in São Paulo, Brazil. The last 20 years I've been working with editorial design, webdesign and front-end development, video editing, timelapse photography, motion graphics and 3D rendering.

I started as an editorial designer developing graphic projects for magazines. After I graduated as a Multimedia Designer in 2004, I started to design and develop websites and  later to edit videos and doing some jobs related do motion graphics and 3D animation.
